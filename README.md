# 1. Welcome on board
You can do hard things

Take a deep breath. You’re here - you made it. Take note of how you’re feeling after watching that video, and give that feeling a name. Think about where in your body you felt it and what it felt like.

You are joining a movement of thousands of people across Africa who know in the marrow of their bones how great Africa’s potential is; who hold in their hearts her greatest hopes, dreams, and ambitions; and whose hands are ready to be a part of building the future that they know is possible.

Joining the Software Engineering Community means that you recognize the immense potential that technology has for transforming Africa and solving grand challenges ranging from agriculture and food security to access to quality healthcare and education. You are willing to contribute your most important resources, your time and energy, to build a future where tech unlocks this potential.

You are willing and able to do the hard things - even when no one believes in you.
